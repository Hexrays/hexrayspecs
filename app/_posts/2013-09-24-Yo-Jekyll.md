# 'Allo, 'Allo!

This is so long overdue. Before I started my internship at [Luxurious Animals][lux] I had begun planning. When I got home on my first day I was giong to build a blog. I had heard a bit about Jekyll and it sounded much more interesting than Wordpress and the like so I figure that would be the way to go. I would use this blog to document my time spent as an intern and talk about all the sweet side projects I had been brainstorming. I had a ton of ideas. They were all amazing I swear.

Then I started. It's my first full-time job in about 6 years. A complete career change. That was July 8th. Today is September 24th. This blog is still not up. I just needed some more interesting Lorem Ipsum content. And possibly spell check. Any way here I am a long time later finally getting around to the project I thought I was going to have up and running my first week. I'm building this from scratch with [Jekyll][jekyll] and I'm super excited to have found the [Jekyllrb generator][generator] for [Yeoman][yo]. I love yeoman.

I kinda hope no one ever finds this post.
